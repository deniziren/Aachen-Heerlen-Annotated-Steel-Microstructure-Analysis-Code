# Aachen-Heerlen-Annotated-Steel-Microstructure-Analysis-Code
This is the supporting code for the Aachen-Heerlen Annotated Steel Microstructure Dataset. 

The study of steel microstructures allow material scientists to gain information regarding the mechanical characteristics of the sample. Bainitic steels may contain martensite-austenite islands that appear as blocky structures with abstract shapes. These are difficult to identify even by the experts of the field. State-of-the-art machine learning models may help material scientists to detect these microstructures automatically and calculate the morphological features that indirectly relate to the mechanical characteristics of the steel. 

This code repository was created as supplementary material for our Nature SciData dataset descriptor. The data includes expert-annotated points and polygons that relate to identified martensite-austenite islands on scanning electron microscopy images of various steel specimens. The procedure of how the dataset was curated can be seen on the dataset descriptor. The data can be directly used to train computer vision machine learning models. 

This code repository includes two Jupyter Notebooks that will guide the reader in a stepwise manner to load and analyze the data.
